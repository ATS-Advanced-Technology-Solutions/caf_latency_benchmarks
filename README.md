# What is this project about

This project provides a suite of benchmarks for **[C++ Actor Framework](https://www.actor-framework.org/)**.
All benchamarks focus on  _latency_ performances while controlling _throughput_.
The main goal is to measure CAF _reactivity_ at **high message rates** as well as at **very low message rates**.



# How this benchmark works

In this benchmark actors send messages to each other with configurable payloads in order to measure performances of CAF framework.


### Executor actor

- Build (eventually multiple) pipeline actors chain(s) by calling topology builder.
- Starts the benchmark sending messages to the head of chain(s) or at the rate generator.
- Sends results and statistics to the `result_collector_actor`.


### Rate generator

- Sends messages at a given rate to the head of the pipeline.
- If there are multiple chains, it sends messages with the specified policy to the heads.


### Topology builder

- Spawns the requested number of benchmark actors (one of them may be detached).
- Returns the head of the chain to the `executor_actor`.


### Benchmark actor

- A `benchmark_actor` knows its previous and its next pipeline item and sends messages forth and back to them (depending on benchmark type).
- For latency tracking type benchmark, the last actor of the pipeline take the _stop time_ in order to compute the time between the first message dispatch and the stop time.
- For _cross-times_ tracking type benchmark, each benchmark actor adds an hop to the _cross-times_ istance in the message.


### Result collector actor

- Collects statistics on system resources usage.
- Writes statistics collected from the `executor_actor` to file.



# How to use this benchmark

In order to run the executable needs the `caf_latency_benchmarks.ini` file in a folder named config.

It will output results in a semicolon-separated _CSV_ file configurable with the `result_path`, `extension` and `output_file`  parameters of _.ini_ file.

Run executable with `--help` to see available command line options.

See the provided _.ini_ file to see al available parameters.

In addition to the benchmark-specific options provided in the _.ini_ file, _CAF_ specific options can be added both either to the _.ini_ file or to the command line, for istance in order to change _CAF scheduler_ policies.

Using the benchmark from command line may look like the following:

`>  ./caf_latency_benchmarks --caf#work-stealing.moderate-sleep-duration=1 --caf#work-stealing.relaxed-steal-interval=5 --caf#work-stealing.relaxed-sleep-duration=200 --benchmark.pipeline_actors=12 --parallel.rate=1000 --benchmark.duration=100`

Tha may output:

`Total average latency (ns): 19096`

While the output result _CSV_ file may look like:

`> cat trace//benchmark_result_PARALLEL.txt`
`number of actors;sender message rate (msg/s);percentage sender error;all actor latency (us);pipeline actor latency (us);receiver message rate (msg/s);percentage receiver error`
`12;999.999;5.3666e-05;1.591;0.946;999.999;0.00010734`



### Message passing overhead (parallel benchmark only)

`-P, --benchmark.payload_type = [NONE|COMPLEX]`

CAF Benchmark support two message type:

- `NONE`: a weightless messages (pure latency measure)
- `COMPLEX`: message composed by a _std::string_ and a _C struct_ with some fixed data and a _std::vector&lt;char&gt;_

The string lenght and vector size configuration parameters:

`--payload.string_length, --payload.vector_size`

In addition, it is possilbe to configure an actor computing time in _microseconds_:

`--payload.actor_computing_time=t`

This will cause every benchmark `benchmark_actor` to do some computation for `t` _microseconds_ before sending a message to the next pipeline actor.



### Actor topology


#### Number of actors

`-N, --pipeline_actors`

Linear topology with a fixed number of actors.


#### Detached actor

` --benchmark.detach = [0 |...| N-1]`

An actor in the pipeline can be spawned as detached.


#### Chains number (parallel benchmark type only)

`--parallel.chains_number`



### Benchmark type and rates

`-t, â€“benchmark.benchmark_type = [SERIAL|PARALLEL]`

- `SERIAL`: Sends message to head when the previous one arrived ad the end of the chain
- `PARALLEL`: Sends messages to head at a given rate

Parallel message rate can be specified with

`-r, --parallel.rate`


#### forth\_and\_back

`--benchmark.forth_and_back = [0|1]`

Specifies if message must run from head to tail and then back to head again.


#### Sending order (multiple chain topology only)

`--parallel.sending_order = [0|1]`

Sending order policy to the head of the chains(s):

- `0`: Random
- `1`: Round-Robin

In addition it is possible to specify a _batch size_ when sending messages from the  `rate_generator` to the chain heads. This will cause messages to be sent in a _square wave_ fashion:

`--payload.batch_size=N`


#### Tracking type (for complex messages only)

`-K, --benchmark.tracking_type = [LATENCY|XTIMES]`

- `LATENCY:` track latencies between pipeline head and tail only
- `XTIMES:` track idividual actor latencies (_cross-times_)



### Output


#### Filename specification

`--benchmark.result_path`

Folder path where to store output files.

`--benchmark.output_file`

File name where to store the results (__serial_ or __parallel_ will be added depending on the benchmark type).

` --benchmark.extension`

Extension of the output file.

Depending on the benchmark type (serial / parallel), the output filename will be constructed as:

`result_path + benchmark_type + output_file + extension`
